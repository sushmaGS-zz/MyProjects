# MIPS-Pipeline-Simulator
MIPS Simulator to calculate the number of clock cycles it takes to execute each stage of MIPS pipeline.
Program takes an input file that has set of Instructions.
Processes code and calculates clock cycles at each stage (Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory and writeback stages)
Finally generated output is stored back to output file.
