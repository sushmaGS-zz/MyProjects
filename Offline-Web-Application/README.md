<h1><b>Project overview:</b></h1>
As more applications move to the Web, it is tempting to assume 24/7 uninterrupted connectivity for all users, but the reality of the Internet is that interruptions happen and, in situations like air travel, can happen predictably for several hours at a time.
An application developer can specify specific additional resources comprising an HTML5 application (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images) to make an application available for offline use. There are many use cases for this, for example:


Read and compose e-mail
Edit documents
Edit and display presentations
Create to-do lists

So, this project aims to achieve accessing the application when there is no internet.
