Binary Tree : A data struc­ture in which we have nodes con­tain­ing data and two ref­er­ences to other nodes, one on the left and one on the right.
This program is written using test cases in following way. 
Write a failing test, then write code to pass the failing test. This continues as long we meet our requirements.
